This folder contains the portable download package from [keepass.info](http://keepass.info/download.html).
The application depends on .NET or Mono. On a Unix shell it can be started via `./keepass2.sh`. By default,
it should try to open the example KeePass file `../local/example.kdbx`. You need to enter `password` as password.
